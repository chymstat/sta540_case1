## Background of the study
HIV infection is a significant public health problem, especially among the minority men who have sex with men (MSM). Regular HIV test is of help to address the problem because it makes early identification of HIV infection easily and timely, which provides people with enough time to get prevention and treatment. HIV self-tesing approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is a convenient way serving as an alternative to the tests conducted in hospitals. The self-testing kits are accessible to people who have never tested before. Self-testing approach is especially useful for the minority MSM, who are at higher risk of HIV infection. Although there are many advanced prevention methods, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), uptake of HIV testing remains insufficient among high-risk groups. Therefore, promoting HIV test in these groups is important for public health interest.

With the spread of the internet, more studies focus on using platforms such as social media platforms, dating applications, and information search sites to promote HIV testing and to recruit participants for HIV prevention studies. Previous studies have shown that internet platforms can recruit a large number of people, especially those who have difficulties in accessing HIV testing or PeEP sevices. Pulic health projects and research studies have shown that using multiple online platforms to distribute HIV self-testing kits is of high efficiency. However, there is limited evidence comparing the effectiveness of different internet platforms in promoting HIV self-testing. Particularly, we have little knowledge about the differences in promoting self-testing and participant recruitng among social media, dating apps, and search sites. Exploring the effectiveness across platforms could help optimize resource allocation and improve the popularity of HIV self-testing. The study aims to compare HIV self-testing kit ordering rates across different online platforms and discover factors related to the ordering patterns.

## Study objectives
The primary aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different types of internet platforms, including social media platforms, dating applications, and information search sites in promoting HIV self-testing among young Black and Latinx men who have sex with men (MSM) at increased risk of HIV infection. Effectiveness is assessed using HIV self-test kit ordering rates as a proxy for successful promotion. 

Secondary aims include
1. Compare the PrEP uptake across social media sites versus informational sites versus dating apps.
2. Determine how substance use modifies HIV testing and PrEP uptake.
3. Determine how the participant’s psychological stage of change or readiness for HIV testing varies by recruitment method and how the stage impacts the main outcome.
4. Determine the most efficient web-based platform for advertisements related to promotion of HIV home self-test kits (primary outcome) and PrEP uptake (secondary outcome) using conversion from web-based metrics of the chosen platforms.
5. Determine how the impact of participant perceptions about HIV testing and PrEP, stigma, and mistrust of medical providers affects HIV home self-testing (primary outcome).
6. Determine how participants’ rates of sexual delay discounting relate to risk behavior and HIV testing.

## Replicated results

### Baseline characteristics of participants

A total of 254 participants were enrolled from six online platforms. The average age of participants was 24.4 years with SD 3.7 years. 196 of the 254 (78.4%) participants identified as Black/African American and 66 of the 254 (26%) identified as Latinx. Most (91.3%) of the participants never received PrEP before. Only 2% of the participants reported they always used a condom. 210 of the 254 participants (82.7%) reported receptive condomless anal sex during the past 90 days. Most (75.2%) of the participants ever tested for HIV in the past. Among those tested, the median (IQR) time since their last test was 11 months (6-21). Participants who never previously tested reported that their main (41.3%) reasons for not testing were their fear of obtaining a positive HIV result. Detailed results could be found in Table 1 below.
